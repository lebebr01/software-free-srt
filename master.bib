abstract = {Statistical software is the enabling tool of quantitative research and the availability and use of the software can greatly shape which methods are used by researchers. Software that is more accessible is likely to have more users and the methods implemented within the software limits the methods accessible to researchers. Open source software, (e.g. R), has reduced these barriers by making cutting edge statistical methods available to researchers through add-on packages. This manuscript explores the evolution of statistical software within social science research using a research synthesis to establish the state of affairs. Software and statistical analysis keywords were searched in published manuscripts from high impact journals in five disciplines, Economics, Education, Political Science, Public Policy, and Sociology. Analysis was based on research synthesis methods. Implications for open science and reproducibility are discussed.},
